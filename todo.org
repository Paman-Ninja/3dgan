* Data
** TODO Add option to use partial dataset per epoch, or to do validation more frequently than per epoch
** TODO Add option to get_dataset to support not loading the entire dataset unless we need to
* Visualization
** TODO Add option to visualize/montage for the border color.
** TODO visualize/weights should take a layer and find the weights
** TODO visualize/timelapse should use the file created datetime instead of name to order
** TODO Add option to visualize for visualizing both train and test data for comparison
** TODO Add ability to visualize/activations to do it for each checkpoint
** TODO Add option to visualization/weights/activations/etc to allow other image palettes/colors than grayscale (for better visualization)
* Training
** TODO Write summary info to text file for later (non-interactive) review.
** TODO Add ability to plot losses for variational autoencoder (gen loss and latent loss)


* STARTED Add ability to sample from latent vector for such models.
  - State "STARTED"    from "TODO"       [2017-04-21 Fri 18:29]
* TODO Add ability to load dataset into persistent memory to speed up development cycle time.
* TODO Add ability of variational autoencoder to use different batch sizes instead of fixed 256 each time.
* TODO Clean up network graph.
